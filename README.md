 AWS Cloud Practitioner Bootcamp Case Study.

# AWS Cloud Case Study – TalentUp Africa Bootcamp

This project showcases hands-on experience gained during the AWS Cloud Practitioner Bootcamp by TalentUp Africa. It covers core AWS services and configurations through a practical lab-based case study.

##  Tools & Services Used

- **Amazon EC2** – Provisioned virtual servers (instances) for deployment
- **Amazon S3** – Managed and secured cloud storage buckets
- **AWS IAM** – Created and configured user roles and policies for access control
- **Amazon VPC** – Configured networking within AWS for secure communication
- **AWS CLI** – Used for command-line interactions with AWS services

##  Case Study Overview

As part of the bootcamp, I built and configured a cloud-based infrastructure simulating a real-world startup environment:

1. **Provisioned an EC2 instance** and installed necessary software.
2. **Created IAM users, groups, and policies** to follow least privilege access control.
3. **Configured S3 buckets** for file storage and set up versioning.
4. **Implemented secure VPC networking** to isolate resources.
5. Documented and tested access with proper monitoring practices.
